# Advent Of Code 2020

This is a little project that I made for fun to resolve the [Advent Of Code 2020 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020). 

I started a little bit late, a couple of days before it ends. I don't plan to solve it all, I will continue as long as I get some fun doing it.

## The Project

As a mainly iOS developer, I created an Xcode project to solve the puzzles. The language used is Swift. The project consists of a Command Line Tool written in Swift that calculates the answers to the puzzles. Of course, it comes with the proper tests.

## What to Expect

If you decide to look at my code here then I must tell you what I am (or was) focusing on:

I focused on:
* Core components algorithms. I paid attention to the computational complexity and tried to create the most efficient algorithms that I could.
* Modeling the core components of the solutions. Applying Clean Code (good naming, small functions, etc.) and the SOLID principles.
* Testing and practicing TDD.

I did not focus on:
* Parsing the input in a safe manner. I assumed that the input always had the expected format. You will see a lot of force unwraps there.
* Checking for input preconditions in the core components. Again, I assumed that the input is valid.
* Project architecture. The components are grouped by day.
* Learning a new language or technology.

## How Far Did I Get?

Currently I solved up to the [eighth day](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8). 

## Final Words

Have any feedback about the solutions? I'd love to hear from you. You can find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pablo.manuelli), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pablomanuelli) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-manuelli/).

 Thank you for reading!
